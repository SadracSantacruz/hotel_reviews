There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving!

Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",

The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadnâ€™t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\nIf you care to know:\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",

In the lobby-reception area, there was a table set up with ice water, coffee, etc., which was very convenient and appreciated. There is a little sitting area off of the check-in area with brochures galore, so you can sit & relax, drink coffee & look at brochures. Adjacent to this is the place where they serve breakfast. They really do serve a nice breakfast, waffles, etc. The hotel rooms are nice. Nothing fancy, but pretty spacious, clean and comfortable.

The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.",

Our room wasn't ready but we were told that since the housekeeping staff began at -:--am, and that the guests previously in our room had already checked out, that our room would be ready for us by --:--am. We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. \nThe room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.",

         "I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. \nThe room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. \nThe Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) \nOverall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",

Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. \nOn the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. \nOverall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.",

I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio.

Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest.

Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

Rudimentary gym \nRoom service is OK, save that they ask $-- for a pot of tea! \nMake sure you ask for a room overlooking the street. The hotel is rectangular with a central void space which half the rooms look out on. So you tend to have to leave the curtains drawn all day.",

Away from the chaos and noise of Times Square but close enough to walk to sites and subway stops.\nRoom was a good size, especially for NYC, desk, flat screen, - drawer dresser, closet with safe and our room had - twin beds. Both room and bathroom were clean. \nNegative is the windows are definitely not soundproof, had asked for a high floor and unfortunately didn't get one - was told it wasn't available but could ask again the next night.

Staff was friendly, but when we ask for help to print one page with the reservation for the ---- Memorial, they referred us to a computer and printer they have in the lobby, which costs a minimum of - USD. Moreover, when we ask for help for transportation to JFK, they recommended a town car for -- USD and when we asked about the airport shuttle they did not recommend it and gave us another price than the real one, which we found weird. We ended taking the bus for -- USD each and it worked just fine. The room was large bur very worn and not very clean. There was a kitchen but no pots.

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\nThe rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful.

Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning. Would stay again if in town.",

It is clean and the staff is very accomodating. My only complaint is that the fan in the bathroom was noisy and went on automatically when you turned the light on and we tried to keep the light off as much as possible. We've stayed in pricier hotels which charged for internet and breakfast and these are both included. Will stay there again.",

By no means is it a --star hotel, but the room was clean, nice & well-appointed with quaint charm, despite being a bit small. Regardless of that, the staff was very helpful. I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.\nWould recommend again for a getaway for -, but not for families because of the room size.",

         "We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",

It is located about --mins walk from the walk of fame and graumanns chinese theatre and is on most of the tour companie's pick up routes. Our room was nice and big and was very clean. Breakfast was included and it was really nice, the usual toast, cereal, pastries and cooked things. You also get free use of their internet in the business centre, as well as the gym and pool. The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $-- return and pick ups occur every ----- mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! \nWe didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx --- day and was really worth the money. We then did an escorted trip to Universal with Starline which was well organised and Universal is worth visiting!! We also went to Madame Tussauds on the walk of fame which had some good and bad statues!!\nOverall though the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame is worth staying at, its clean, convenient and has some nice free extras thrown in!!",

         "The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. \n-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again. Hope the savings were worth it.",

Check-in was fine, as a HHonors Gold member I was informed with an apology that they did not have an Executive Floor to upgrade me to, but put me in a - bedroom suite and offered me a complimentary buffet breakfast and the usual wifi vouchers. This is where the good things ended.\nThe room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages).

To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.\nI also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening.

         "I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadnâ€™t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\nIf you care to know:\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",

We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant.

We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. \nThe room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.",

The staff in other areas were mostly courteous and professional but the bar staff was wooden and unhelpful. The room itself was a decent size but not big. Furnishing were comfortable enough. The internet was unbelievably slow and had to call the hotel's IT department - times to troubleshoot problems. Not acceptable as they charge $-- a day for internet service. If you use the valet service, expect to wait upwards of -- minutes whenever you want your car. Returning in the evening after dinner, waited about -- minutes to be acknowledged by a member of the valet team. The staff seemed to smile alot but lacked any substantive abilities when dealing with any issues. Had a minor problem with my booking that took far longer than necessary to resolve as the staff were dense and difficult to talk to, as though it were their first day on the job. This hotel seems a magnet for conferences but I couldn't recommend this place for business or leisure purposes. There are much better choices for the money they charge.",

Although Hampton Inn is on the lower end of the Hilton family, this particular hotel out does many higher ranked chains by providing a well managed facility with great touches like free wireless, free hot and cold breakfast and a young but highly trained staff. \nThe only con about the hotel is the parking. It is costly to park any where in downtown denver but this is true for any metropolitan area. The proximity of this hotel to interesting locations nearby for fun and dining makes it worth the extra cash to have a place to park. \nHighly recommended.",

         "I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. \nThe room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. \nThe Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) \nOverall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",

Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. \nOn the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. \nOverall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.",

         "My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"did I get a good deal?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nThe first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.",

Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold. Maintenance needs to scrap out the old and replace with a tan colored caulk. \nOverall, I am very pleased with the property and would stay there again without hesitation.",

         "What a pleasant place to stay!\nThe hotel is beautiful, very modern, stylish, with attention to detail. Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.\nThe bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.\nOne of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.\nThe staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!\nThe restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.\nThe location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp. \nThere is really nothing bad I can say about this hotel. Our stay was truly a pleasure. If there's anything I can suggest is that they should add refrigerators and microwaves to rooms.\nWould love to come back.",

Much more expensive than anywhere else I have been in the States, but perhaps that's the going price in New York.

We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.\nThey say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the -rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face.\nAnd finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are.

The hotel location was excellent, though the architecture of the area immediately surrounding the hotel is rather commercial and boring. Chinatown is close by for dinner and the White House is down the block. The lobby is really beautiful and the receptionist was extremely pleasant. The rate for the room ($--) was very good for the size and the beds were nice and comfortable. I booked it through Hyatt.com and they try to add extras, like early check-in time for $-- or a higher level room for $--. We arrived around --a.m. and were able to check-in and were assigned to the --th floor, without paying for those extras, so they are a waste of money. The hotel is large so sometimes there are elevator wait times, but not excessive. Woke up well rested though the housekeeping staff came by early, by eight o'clock there was a knock on the door. One complaint is that, while there is a gym, apparently it is in an adjacent building and there is a fee for use. Overall a nice and quiet stay, corporate decor of course, but for the rate it was great.",

         "My husband and I stayed at this hotel last night because we wanted to make an early trip to take some of our son's things home from a college in the area. The area was ok although not anything around to do or eat without getting into your car or using the T. They had free parking which was good since almost every hotel charges you for parking. When we first walked into the room, my first impression was ehhh, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be since I got a little nervous when we pulled up seeing the hotel from the outside. The room looked clean enough, was tastefully decorated and had a refrigerator and microwave. When I went into the bathroom there were ants all over the floor. I killed about -- of them. That wasn't too bad, I was more concerned with bed bugs... I checked but thank goodness didn't find any. I did find more ants though, crawling on the chair next to the bed. After being itchy all night thinking about ants crawling on me, I slept with my clothes on and sweatshirt hood on my head. That wasn't the worst of it though...during the night I kept getting a faint smell of vomit. I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress. It wasn't a strong odor but every so often kept getting a whiff. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, disgusting! I should have asked for another room but quite frankly didn't think it would make much of a difference and I figured they didn't have one since they told me that they were booked when I called. We were only going to be there for a night anyway. To top it off, when we went to grab something to eat, we saw a huge rat in the parking lot. If anybody could have seen me sleeping, you would have laughed at the lunatic sleeping in her clothes with her hood tied up tight, wrinkling up her nose from the puke smell...with one eye open worried about rats coming through the bottom of the door. I've been dragging my rear end all day from lack of sleep then had a - hour drive home. To be honest with you, I wouldn't have been so harsh with my review if there were no ants or puke smell, it wouldn't have been too bad because it was surprisingly clean otherwise.",

It is a bit out of the way from the more touristy areas, but the Kenmore Square Green line subway is next door, and easy access to all of Boston. We arrived and met a very nice fellow named Scott, and while check-in was at -, he allowed us to go up to our room at -. The room was small, but clean, and very comfortable with a Queen bed. It was a cute hotel setup, since the building is sort of like a horseshoe shape. I wasn't aware, but the famous architect Mr. White (of McKim, Mead, White fame) designed this! Anyhow, the hotel was clean, the staff wonderful, and for an inexpensive place which is next to Fenway, i highly recommend it!",

This place really fit the bil, and was much less expensive than the downtown hotels. My husband and I were both impressed with the attractiveness of the lobby and room. Everything was clean and new-looking. The prices of snacks-drinks in the lobby mini-market were reasonable. Our daughter loved the indoor pool with its special features such as basketball and waterfall mushroom-sprays. They offered free cookies, flavored waters and newspapers in the lobby. There was plenty of free parking. There were no restaurants in the immediate area, but University was a short drive away with many choices.

Asked front desk for a local Seattle restaurant on my first night. She suggested two cookie-cutter wine bars and a mall restaurant. Not a big deal, but as I became familiar with downtown Seattle, I couldn't believe she didn't recommend The Brooklyn or one of the many other restaurants with true local flavor.

The --th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid --'s. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink. Ice machines are located on floors -, -, and -, however all of them were out of order. Ice was available in the lobby. \nThe door from the garage to the hotel was un-locked at all times.

The garage itself seemed dirty and dingy. \nSound insulation is non-existent. There was a surprising amount of road noise given I was on the --th floor.\nOverall the place looks run down. It isn't dirty, but certainly not as clean as other Fairfield Inns. In fairness, the price was very cheap.\nMy reccomendation to you is to check out the Courtyard Inn about --- mile north on the same road.

Much more expensive than anywhere else I have been in the States, but perhaps that's the going price in New York. What I considered a ripoff however was the $--- day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.\nThey say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the -rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face.\nAnd finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are. We were gone all day, never made any noise at night and kept the room tidy so it's not like we were disruptive or sloppy guests.\nSo really great location, room was ok, breakfast was great, don't count on the service...",

On our last visit which was thanksgiving weekend we were extremely disappointed and have decided we are not going to have visit again. First of all we checked in to two rooms ; one for us and one for my mil (mother in law). When we arrived her room had water by the sliding door and our bathroom was experiencing some plumbing issues because the sinks were making sounds etc. The next day mil room was imense in water (bathroom and hall area); we were told they had some sort water issue upstairs, but didnt mention that on the first day! they were blaming the water sprinklers.

         "I stayed here overnight with my grandmother during August. The hotel location was excellent, though the architecture of the area immediately surrounding the hotel is rather commercial and boring. Chinatown is close by for dinner and the White House is down the block. The lobby is really beautiful and the receptionist was extremely pleasant. The rate for the room ($--) was very good for the size and the beds were nice and comfortable. I booked it through Hyatt.com and they try to add extras, like early check-in time for $-- or a higher level room for $--. We arrived around --a.m. and were able to check-in and were assigned to the --th floor, without paying for those extras, so they are a waste of money. The hotel is large so sometimes there are elevator wait times, but not excessive. Woke up well rested though the housekeeping staff came by early, by eight o'clock there was a knock on the door. One complaint is that, while there is a gym, apparently it is in an adjacent building and there is a fee for use. Overall a nice and quiet stay, corporate decor of course, but for the rate it was great.",

         "My husband and I stayed at this hotel last night because we wanted to make an early trip to take some of our son's things home from a college in the area. The area was ok although not anything around to do or eat without getting into your car or using the T. They had free parking which was good since almost every hotel charges you for parking. When we first walked into the room, my first impression was ehhh, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be since I got a little nervous when we pulled up seeing the hotel from the outside. The room looked clean enough, was tastefully decorated and had a refrigerator and microwave. When I went into the bathroom there were ants all over the floor. I killed about -- of them. That wasn't too bad, I was more concerned with bed bugs... I checked but thank goodness didn't find any. I did find more ants though, crawling on the chair next to the bed. After being itchy all night thinking about ants crawling on me, I slept with my clothes on and sweatshirt hood on my head. That wasn't the worst of it though...during the night I kept getting a faint smell of vomit. I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress. It wasn't a strong odor but every so often kept getting a whiff. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, disgusting! I should have asked for another room but quite frankly didn't think it would make much of a difference and I figured they didn't have one since they told me that they were booked when I called. We were only going to be there for a night anyway. To top it off, when we went to grab something to eat, we saw a huge rat in the parking lot. If anybody could have seen me sleeping, you would have laughed at the lunatic sleeping in her clothes with her hood tied up tight, wrinkling up her nose from the puke smell...with one eye open worried about rats coming through the bottom of the door. I've been dragging my rear end all day from lack of sleep then had a - hour drive home. To be honest with you, I wouldn't have been so harsh with my review if there were no ants or puke smell, it wouldn't have been too bad because it was surprisingly clean otherwise.",

After looking on tripadvisor, i settled on the Hotel Buckminster, and boy was i glad i did. This hotel is in a perfect location near Fenway Park. It is a bit out of the way from the more touristy areas, but the Kenmore Square Green line subway is next door, and easy access to all of Boston. We arrived and met a very nice fellow named Scott, and while check-in was at -, he allowed us to go up to our room at -. The room was small, but clean, and very comfortable with a Queen bed. It was a cute hotel setup, since the building is sort of like a horseshoe shape. I wasn't aware, but the famous architect Mr. White (of McKim, Mead, White fame) designed this! Anyhow, the hotel was clean, the staff wonderful, and for an inexpensive place which is next to Fenway, i highly recommend it!",

         "We were with a large group of -- on on our way to my sons baseball tournament. There were -- of us and we arrived at - am to check in, after taking a red eye from Califonia. Most of the people in our group were children. The staff welcomed us (Thank you Gio) allowed us to eat breakfast and crash in the lobby until our rooms were ready. They got all of us in quickly and when our suite wasn't ready they gave us two standard rooms so we would have plenty of room for our family to be comfortable, at no extra charge. The location was great, right across from the Garden home of the Bruins, and we were there when they won the Stanley cup. Even though the game was in Canada the area was packed with excitment. We were excited to be a part of it all and became Bruins fans!\nThe Boston police did an excellent job of keeping everything under control. The hotel did an excellent job of handling the extra traffic and chaos too. The manger, Jamie, was very nice and gave ice cream and candy treats to the kids. The area did not seem bad to me at all. There are a lot of pubs in the area, but there seem to be alot of pubs all over Boston. We were with in walking distance of many areas of attraction and we were able to purchase our tour bus tickets at the front desk and catch the bus across the street. The rooms were nothing fancy, but every one in our group agreed that this was a great experience and we would stay here again.",

The downside was that the A-C was making a noise and the faucet in the bathroom was loose - things that can be easily fixed.

Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.\nThe bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.\nOne of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.\nThe staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!\nThe restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.\nThe location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp. \nThere is really nothing bad I can say about this hotel. Our stay was truly a pleasure. If there's anything I can suggest is that they should add refrigerators and microwaves to rooms.\nWould love to come back.",

      "1. Visited Seattle on business. Spent - nights in the Vintage Park. Great location. Room was nice. Bathroom was nice and clean. Thermostat didn't work-had to open the windows to cool the room off. Upon check-in, they asked if I wanted turn-down service. I said yes. Never happened. Asked front desk for a local Seattle restaurant on my first night. She suggested two cookie-cutter wine bars and a mall restaurant. Not a big deal, but as I became familiar with downtown Seattle, I couldn't believe she didn't recommend The Brooklyn or one of the many other restaurants with true local flavor. Joined the Kimpton loyalty club upon arriving. Was supposed to get the WSJ. Never even received USA Today. But I did get free internet, which saved me some money. No pool. I knew this before I made the reservation, but it was not immediately clear--had to do some searching.\n",

Our room was on the top floor facing --th St. The room was clean and the staff very helpful and accommodating. The downside was that the A-C was making a noise and the faucet in the bathroom was loose - things that can be easily fixed. We walked from the hotel to Madison Square Gardens, to Times Square and on to Broadway. Everything considered, I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.\n",

      "3. Unlike some hotels that grimace when you show up with a family (rather than a solo business traveler), the staff here went out of their way to help us. The front desk staff graciously checked us in at noon the day we arrived. The next day Maureen, the concierge, suggested age appropriate activities and mapped out subway routes for us. The amenities here are a big help too. The refrigerator allowed us to store water and snacks, and the kitchen table (although small) gave us a spot to park everyone rather than sitting on the beds. We took advantage of the breakfast each morning. The buffet offers good quality food and a big selection of hot and cold items. Everyone could find something they liked. Having a free breakfast saved us a lot of money!\n",

      "1. This is - min away from Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, so very good location. I got the room through one of the discount sites, don't know if the staff knows and treats us accordingly, I'll come back to that. Room included continental breakfast, it was excellent - fresh pastries, good orange juice and coffee, fruit salad, bagels. You could also pay for \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"a la carte\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" if you wanted a hot breakfast. There was also free coffee early in the morning. I used the business office every day, good internet access, free printing, that was nice.\n",
      "We had a room with a king bed, there was - of us, so I asked for a rollaway bed, $--- night. Much more expensive than anywhere else I have been in the States, but perhaps that's the going price in New York. What I considered a ripoff however was the $--- day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.\n",
      "They say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the -rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face.\n",
      "And finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are. We were gone all day, never made any noise at night and kept the room tidy so it's not like we were disruptive or sloppy guests.\n",
      "So really great location, room was ok, breakfast was great, don't count on the service...\n",

      "2. My husband and I stayed at this hotel last night because we wanted to make an early trip to take some of our son's things home from a college in the area. The area was ok although not anything around to do or eat without getting into your car or using the T. They had free parking which was good since almost every hotel charges you for parking. When we first walked into the room, my first impression was ehhh, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be since I got a little nervous when we pulled up seeing the hotel from the outside. The room looked clean enough, was tastefully decorated and had a refrigerator and microwave. When I went into the bathroom there were ants all over the floor. I killed about -- of them. That wasn't too bad, I was more concerned with bed bugs... I checked but thank goodness didn't find any. I did find more ants though, crawling on the chair next to the bed. After being itchy all night thinking about ants crawling on me, I slept with my clothes on and sweatshirt hood on my head. That wasn't the worst of it though...during the night I kept getting a faint smell of vomit. I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress. It wasn't a strong odor but every so often kept getting a whiff. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, disgusting! I should have asked for another room but quite frankly didn't think it would make much of a difference and I figured they didn't have one since they told me that they were booked when I called. We were only going to be there for a night anyway. To top it off, when we went to grab something to eat, we saw a huge rat in the parking lot. If anybody could have seen me sleeping, you would have laughed at the lunatic sleeping in her clothes with her hood tied up tight, wrinkling up her nose from the puke smell...with one eye open worried about rats coming through the bottom of the door. I've been dragging my rear end all day from lack of sleep then had a - hour drive home. To be honest with you, I wouldn't have been so harsh with my review if there were no ants or puke smell, it wouldn't have been too bad because it was surprisingly clean otherwise.\n",

      "3. I paid $-- a night, not bad for San Francisco, but beware, there are a lot of homeless people on the block where the hotel is located, they will hound you for money, if you ignore them and keep walking.....There is always people on the streets, locals, shoppers, and a lot of tourist.....When you go out of the hotel, you must leave your room key with desk clerk.\n",
      "The rooms are small, make sure you get the own bathroom, if you get shared, you must go to end of the hall and use the community bathrooms. Bring your own hairdryer, they advertise in room, but did not see one.....Had to do without one....Skimpy towels too!!\n",

      "1. Looking for a motel in close proximity to TV taping of a Dr. Phil show, we chose the Dunes on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood. Although the property displayed the AAA emblem, it certainly left a lot to be desired. There were chips & scrapes on the bottom of the door frame in the bathroom and the lotion containers were half full--apparently not replaced by housekeeping. We needed an early wakeup call, but couldn't use the clock radio alarm as there wasn't a radio in the room. There was no TV channel listing on the remote, or on the TV menu making viewing a chore.The TV remote had to be returned when checking-out. This place served its purpose, but not a place to revisit.\n",

      "3. There's a reason why so many of the previous reviews say this place is awful. It's because it is. I stayed here because it was one on the only rooms available downtown due to some convention. Within the first few seconds of walking in the lobby I noticed how dirty it was...like they hadn't vacuumed in weeks. My room was just as bad. It overlooked an ally piled with garbage, and crawling with giant rats. I counted at least ten. The shabby depressing room(non-smoking) reeked of stale cigarette smoke. The water never got warm enough to take a decent shower. I can go on, but you get the picture\n",

      "1. This hotel location is excellent and the rooms are very clean. Our suite was a one bedroom apartment with a full kitchen but a very small bathroom. The staff is friendly and helpful but the rooms do need to be revised. The linens and bedding was hard and outdated. The air conditioner did not work and the heater was on and could not be turned off or adjusted. Althought it was cold outside we felt we were in a sauna and had to open the windows for air. We were told by the staff that at a certain temperature outside the air would not turn on and the heater would go on automatically. This was not a good thing......we were sweating even with the windows open.......\n",

      "3. This is not your typical Fairfield Inn architecture. This is -- floor building with an underground parking garage. I don't know if this was built to be a Fairfield Inn or converted to one. The customer service was typical of a Marriott propertry--very good. That, however, couldn't save this place.\n",
      "I had a room on the --th floor. It was spooky. The --th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid --'s. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink. Ice machines are located on floors -, -, and -, however all of them were out of order. Ice was available in the lobby. \n",
      "The door from the garage to the hotel was un-locked at all times. See a previous review about the door being \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"broken\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". The garage itself seemed dirty and dingy. \n",
      "Sound insulation is non-existent. There was a surprising amount of road noise given I was on the --th floor.\n",
      "Overall the place looks run down. It isn't dirty, but certainly not as clean as other Fairfield Inns. In fairness, the price was very cheap.\n",
      "My reccomendation to you is to check out the Courtyard Inn about --- mile north on the same road. My reccomendation to Marriott is a.) close the --th floor and do a complete re-model, or take your good name off this property!\n",
