It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them.

Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",

The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

Womp womp womp...\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\nIf you care to know:\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",

In the lobby-reception area, there was a table set up with ice water, coffee, etc., which was very convenient and appreciated. There is a little sitting area off of the check-in area with brochures galore, so you can sit & relax, drink coffee & look at brochures. Adjacent to this is the place where they serve breakfast. They really do serve a nice breakfast, waffles, etc. The hotel rooms are nice. Nothing fancy, but pretty spacious, clean and comfortable.

The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.",

Our room wasn't ready but we were told that since the housekeeping staff began at -:--am, and that the guests previously in our room had already checked out, that our room would be ready for us by --:--am. We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. \nThe room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.",

         "I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. \nThe room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. \nThe Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) \nOverall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",

Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. \nOn the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. \nOverall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.",

I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio.

Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest.

Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold. Maintenance needs to scrap out the old and replace with a tan colored caulk. \nOverall, I am very pleased with the property and would stay there again without hesitation.",

There is a quiet bar area and there is a restaurant attached where breaksfast is served - but that is it. Rudimentary gym \nRoom service is OK, save that they ask $-- for a pot of tea! \nMake sure you ask for a room overlooking the street. The hotel is rectangular with a central void space which half the rooms look out on. So you tend to have to leave the curtains drawn all day.",

Away from the chaos and noise of Times Square but close enough to walk to sites and subway stops.\nRoom was a good size, especially for NYC, desk, flat screen, - drawer dresser, closet with safe and our room had - twin beds. Both room and bathroom were clean. \nNegative is the windows are definitely not soundproof, had asked for a high floor and unfortunately didn't get one - was told it wasn't available but could ask again the next night. We heard all the noise -trash trucks, sounds outside, etc..honking, sirens. \nOther then not having soundproof windows, I would recommend staying here - nice place and nice location",

Hotel is well located with a couple of good places to eat and a Starbuck within walking distance. The walk to the Grand Central Station is of about -- minutes. Staff was friendly, but when we ask for help to print one page with the reservation for the ---- Memorial, they referred us to a computer and printer they have in the lobby, which costs a minimum of - USD. Moreover, when we ask for help for transportation to JFK, they recommended a town car for -- USD and when we asked about the airport shuttle they did not recommend it and gave us another price than the real one, which we found weird. We ended taking the bus for -- USD each and it worked just fine. The room was large bur very worn and not very clean. There was a kitchen but no pots. I will only recommend this hotel if you get it for a very reasonable price. In a future NYC trip I will for sure stay somewhere else.",

Our only real objection was a very small room with no room for an ironing board to begin with, queen, not king size bed, tiny closet and no place to put your luggage so it has to be opened on the floor. Sound transference between rooms was also a problem along with door slamming in halls. On balance this was a good value b-c we paid under $--- on Hotwire, but I would have been bummed if I'd paid full freight.",

The walls facing the bed are the windows so you have the impression to be in the clouds. GREAT VIEW (room ----)!!! Room very quiet and the bedding is good quality! However, one negative point: I stayed for - nights and the first morning we left at -am and when we returned at -pm the room still wasn't done! the maid arrived at -pm to clean the room! I didn't ask for anything because i did the bed by myself at -pm ! for the remaining services, the hotel is new so the staff is not perfect but they try! nice snack in the morning with coffee and a choice of - different muffins ! I recommend it for the room with this amazing view!",

If you are coming from LGA, take the Q-- to the bus-subway station and transfer to the E. The E is express to Manhattan during the day and the trip is quick. This is a good way to go since the Q-- pulls into the bus depot, you can't miss your stop and it is also the subway station. Safe at all times of the day. \nIt is funny to look out the hotel window because it looks the same day or night....Just bright lights all over which is what you come to Times Square to see.

         "The price for my stay in December was approximately $--- a night, which is pretty good for a two-room studio with King Bed, Full-Sized Fridge, Kitchen Table, Foldout Couch, and RCA Jack friendly Television set. \nI booked two nights on a Friday and Saturday. I had heard, from reading other reviews, the walls are paper thin. I also heard that fast food is not an easy find. Well, it's true. The walls are very thin, and finding fast food was a chore.\nNot one night passed without hearing sounds of people talking in neighboring rooms. In the living room, I could hear the family next door talking and watching T.V. In the bedroom I could hear the people on the other side of the wall talking and watching T.V. The loudest noises, however, came from the outside hallway (mostly kids running up and down the halls) and the window, which faced the pool. I was on the third floor, but it didn't help much. The noise from the pool echoed into my room all day and up until - p.m. or so in the evening. As for sleeping in, it didn't happen in this hotel. I tried both mornings, and woke each day at - a.m. to the sound of slamming doors or kids running up and down the hallway. In some strange way, it reminded me of Disney Land, just outside my front door! On the plus side, the King bed was extremely comfortable! It's just too bad the noise was so loud.\nIn spite of all the noise, the room was nice and the occupants of the hotel all seemed friendly and family oriented. This is definitely a place for married couples with kids. I felt safe my entire stay.\nAs for food, it's hard to find unless you plan on taking in a sit-down meal. Check-in time is at - p.m. I arrived my first day at - p.m. Unfortunately, my room was not ready, and I was told I would have to come back later. I drove around looking for something to eat but couldn't find anything of the fast-food variety anywhere near the hotel. I drove past the local mall, down a few side streets, and eventually found a Wendy’s. The problem is, it was about -- minutes away from the room, and with traffic congestion somewhat prevalent in the Hotel Circle area, it took me a while to get there and get back. One bit of advice: bring your own food. It's cheaper and you'll thank yourself later. Also, there is no room service, etc., so if you get a late night craving, you’re on your own.\nOverall, the hotel was decent. It's loud and parking at $-- a night seemed high, but the people were nice enough. Also, the elevators in this building are very slow! Slow to arrive, slow to open the doors. I couldn’t believe how long I had to wait. Use the stairs if you’re in a rush. It's a good workout and you won't have to wait around five minutes for the elevator to pick you up!\nOne final comment. It would be nice if the hotel had more parking spots for guests of hotel guests. There are only about - total spots in front of the hotel. A business associate stopped by one evening to visit me and had to wait -- minutes to find a parking spot. Parking in the back for hotel guests is pretty abundant, but you must have a room card to park there, along with a hotel parking pass to display in your window. Also, it does fill up late at night, but most other times it's easy to find a spot.",

         "I stayed here for - nights on business and below are my thoughts. \nThe Good:\nCheck in and check out was swift and easy and I found the staff really helpful so all good there. The room was big with two queen beds and a sofa area so you certainly didn't get cabin fever and the bed itself was super comfortable. The location is good too, just off Michigan so if you're in Chicago for the shopping you're only a stone's throw away. It's also no dramas to walk to many of the other good places to go out at night.\nThe Average-not so good:\nThe hotel is tired and in need of an update, the rooms especially are showing their age and there's really not a lot to the hotel other then the rooms. To be fair there is a small indoor pool and mini gym on the -th floor and a small restaurant too on the ground floor but with so many options locally to choose from to eat we went out for every meal. Didn't think too much of the cleanliness of the room, my bathroom was full of previous guest's hairs on arrival.\nWould I stay here again? No, as I would hope the next time I come back to Chicago I would get a better hotel for the money I paid this time round (The Bears were playing at home so I'm sure the rate was jacked up because of that) but if you're just after a room to crash in and you get a decent rate then this is a good option but if you're after more than a room then look elsewhere.",

Once you get to the -nd floor, you must again struggle with your luggage to get to the check-in area where there are bell hops just waiting around at the Cherry Street entrance. What is wrong with this picture??? The street noise at night is loud but luckily I had brought my Brookstone Sound Therapy System with me. I think limos are the only form of transportation that drops you off and picks you up at the Cherry Street entrance. I took a limo back to the airport and it really was not any more expensive than a taxi and well worth every penny. I found the food at the Juno Restaurant to be very good.

         "The Affinia Dumont is certainly all the reviews make out. We picked it after many hours of seaching in the net to find a space that would suit a family of four (with two teenagers) comfortably, was central to the touristy spots, shopping and food. What we found was a safe neighborhood which surpassed our expectations.\nPrior to arrival, we had arranged with the hotel for a car to met us at the airport as this was past midnight. The concierge and I did this over the phone a few days earlier and everything went without a hitch. Upon arrival however, we were given two rooms as the - bedroom apartment we had reserved was not available that night - not such a great start but after -- hours of travel, a bed was a bed. The rooms were switched the next morning and we had our apartment with a rollaway and the sofa bed made up for the two kids. The rest of the stay was comfortable and we found the staff friendly and efficient. The concierges were helpful and were a good source of advance purchase tickets and bookings. The one thing we learnt quickly about New York attractions was that express tickets albeit slightly more expensive are worth every penny unless you wanted to spend hours in the queue..... and queues there were.\nThe - bedroom apartment was certainly comfortable enough for four although a tad crowded with the sofa bed and rollaway, we still had enough room for four. There was plenty of storage space to put luggage out of the way which helped. The kitchenette was basic - good for heating up meals but I would not attempt to cook a proper meal in it. \nThe hotel in Midtwon East Manhattan is at the border of Murray Hill and Soho. There is an eclectic mix of small shops, business districts and residential properties within a - block radius. Down Lexington, -rd Avenue, and Madison are restaurants galore. The best ones we found were Serge, a French brasserie on Madison; Da Ciro, an Italian place on Lexington and the Lemongrass Grill (Thai) right next to the hotel. The Lemongrass and the Grand Sichuan (round the corner on Lexington) do takeaways as well. Final orders are about -.-- pm and both are good places for a warm takeaway meal if looking for a late dinner. -rd Avenue also houses a few clothes shops and the Shoe Box which stocks designer shoes at a reasonable price.\n A stroll down Park Avenue, lined with grand old brownstones and cherry trees in spring, takes you towards the Grand Central Station surrounded by shopping and more places to eat. Two blocks down turning left from the hotel leads you towards -th Ave and slightly further was the iconic Macy's. Public transport was aplenty although we did not attempt to take any, while taxis generally cost about $- to $-- from the hotel to most of the touristy spots including Times Square at the height of rush hour traffic. \nRight at the corner of --th and Lexington on the same block as the Dumont is the Murray Hill Market, a well stocked provision shop which is also a -- hour deli with the most delectable fresh sandwich and salad bar. It was certainly frequented by our son! Opposite on the next block is Guy & Gallard - another deli which has great bagels for breakfast and coffee, especially if you are looking for a good cup of cappuccino. A few doors up is the Symphony Laundry, offering a next day service for a very good price with an extremely helpful and friendly proprietress. \nWe would return to the Dumont again if back on holiday. The only thing i would do different is ask for a room above the -- th floor for a better view and get the hotel staff to look into the air-conditioning system which seemed to cut off after midnight and coming back on in the early hours. The room could get too hot to sleep properly. However, I liked the neighbourhood and it was fun walking about the hotel area in the morning watching the various streets come alive with my takeout coffee while the family are still curled up in bed.",

Lovely views over Manhattan. Staff were gorgeous and everyone was incredibly helpful and sympathetic towards me (single mother), although they are a tad disorganised. Food was delicious and not unreasonably priced, cocktails on the sky terrace a bit ho hum, children not allowed in the gym swimming pool which you can get membership to (it's across the street), which was not what I'd been told, and there were various muddles like that. It's an immense skyscraper and the corridors are a bit spooky - at times I think the design crosses the line between cool postmodern and weird sinister but generally I had a blast here and would happily go again.",

Next time I will stay at the Omni up the road (my usual stay) or the Crowne Plaza which I stayed at last time (which had the most comfortable bed ever but wasn't quite as nice as the Omni).\nFirst, as I checked in (very nice guy) I was told I was being upgraded to their premier floor (-th floor). I was told these rooms were bigger and they had refrigerators, and also told to park by a certain door. Well, I was told to park at the opposite door that I should have (I had a few heavy bags and dinner in my hands), the room was average in size (couldn't imagine it being much smaller unless it was in the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hot\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" areas in NYC, San Fran, or Chicago), and there was no refrigerator. I'm not upset about the size of the room or the fridge at all.\nWell, I am currently sitting in a broken chair I almost fell out of twice already, the internet is free wireless but in and out with the connection, and the television has been out for quite some time now. I pulled the tv out of the armoire to turn it toward the desk area and I literally almost dropped it on the floor. There are little bugs crawling on the mirror I am looking at right now, a couple more on this desk, and I keep losing the wireless connection (- times in this post so far). \nThe location is good, area around is ok, kinda, and again the staff was very courteous.
